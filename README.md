# Gamin-Coursework-Vol-2

The file Zenith Ndim working graph creates a graph of the probabilities that govern the unifrom distribution of the mixed equilibria.
The file Zenith Ndim working Sectiones prints out the mixed equilibria with certain repeats
The file Zenith k is 1 prints out the mixed equilibria and probabilities when k = 1

Please do use either of the Ndim files to have fun seeing other equilibria. When k = 3 time taken is quite a while so do take that into account!
